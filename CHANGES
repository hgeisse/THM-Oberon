	change CPU version of RISC5 simulator to 5.5

	enlarge address space of RISC5 simulator to 16 MB:
	RAM base:   0x000000
	RAM size:   0xFFE000 (16 MB - 8 KB)
	PROM base:  0xFFE000
	PROM size:  0x001000 (max, allocated from base)
	I/O base:   0xFFF000
	I/O size:   0x001000 (max, allocated from top)

	move display frame buffer (simulator) to high memory:
	dfb base:   0xFE0000 (16 MB - 128 KB, i.e., within RAM)
	dfb size:   0x018000 (1024 * 768 / 8, 1 bit per pixel)

	change origin and limit constants (PROM used in simulator):
	stackOrg:   0x800000 (8 MB)
	heapOrg:    ditto
	memLim:     0xFE0000 (i.e., the dsp base)
	heapLim:    ditto

	change software base to Andreas Pirklbauer's Extended-Oberon-1.6
	(see kit-RISC5/NOTES for changes from his release to our kit)

	move display frame buffer (hardware) to high memory
	change origin and limit constants (PROM used in hardware)


14-Aug-2022
	change CPU version of RISC5 simulator to 8.0
	re-interpret MOV' (form 0), v=0/1 instructions as PUTS/GETS
	these instructions write or read a special register, respectively
	the special register's number is encoded in the 4 LSBs (field "c")
	NOTES:
	1. The instruction code for reading the ID register is left as is
	   (0x3y000000, with the destination register in nibble y). This
	   way it is possible to detect the CPU version in any case.
	2. The contents of the ID register do *not* reflect the values of
	   the flags any longer, but only the CPU version (0x00000080) in
	   the 8 LSBs. The remaining 24 MSBs of the ID are currently set
	   to zero, but may be defined otherwise later.
	3. The instruction code for reading the H register *is* changed,
	   from 0x2y000000 to 0x3y000001.
	4. The instruction codes 0x2y00000s are reserved for *writing*
	   a special register (its number is in nibble "s"). The register
	   "y" becomes the source of this data transfer. Note that writing
	   into the ID register has no effect at all.
	5. Currently, the following special register numbers are assigned:
	     0: ID    CPU version as described above
	     1: H     the mul/div auxiliary register
	     2: PSW   processor status word, exact bit assignments t.b.d.
	     3: XSW   exception status word (was formerly the non-accessible
	              SPC register), exact bit assignments t.b.d.
	     4: FPC   reserved for floating-point control
	6. In Oberon, the semantics of SYSTEM.H(x) with x = 0 or x = 1
	   is completely left unchanged: H(0) reads the H register, H(1)
	   reads the ID register.
