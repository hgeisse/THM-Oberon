1. Choose one of the three implementations of a multiplier:
     make choose-Wirth
     make choose-Straube
     make choose-Geisse
   This copies the respective implementation to the file "multiplier.v".
2. Choose one of the two sets of test cases:
     make choose-s
     make choose-u
   This copies the respective set to the file "ref.dat".
3. Run the simulation with "make run". Look at the signal
   "error" at a time where "done" is 1.
