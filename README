Welcome to THM-Oberon!

In this project we ported Niklaus Wirth's Oberon system to
Terasic's DE2-115 FPGA development board. We decided to start
not from Wirth's original "Project Oberon", but from Andreas
Pirklbauer's "Extended Oberon", for a variety of reasons.

We achieved our goal in two different ways:

1. We constructed a version of RISC5 (Wirth's microprocessor
system for his Oberon project) for the DE2-115.

2. On a different path, we retargeted the Oberon compiler
to our ECO32, which is a well established independent 32-bit
microcomputer system running on the DE2-115 (among other FPGA
boards). This line of development will not be continued.
A fully functional version can however be downloaded from
here (under the tag v1.0).

3. Further development will address
   - more/other/enhanced I/O devices
   - the latest version of Extended Oberon
   - a more powerful implementation of RISC5
