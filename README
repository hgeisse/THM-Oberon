Welcome to THM-Oberon!

This project tries to port Niklaus Wirth's Oberon system to
Terasic's DE2-115 FPGA development board. We decided to start
not from Wirth's original "Project Oberon", but from Andreas
Pirklbauer's "Extended Oberon", for a variety of reasons.

We want to achieve our goal in two different ways: First by
constructing a version of RISC5 (Wirth's processor for his
Oberon project) for the DE2-115. On a different path, we try
to retarget the Oberon compiler to our ECO32, which is a well
established independent 32-bit microcomputer system running
on the DE2-115 (among other FPGA boards).
