1) Choose an argument ARG for the root call such that the
   total runtime can be neasured easily with a stopwatch.
   Consulting the table, check that all numbers are below
   the 2G barrier for 32-bit signed integers. Compile the
   Module.

2) Run the command Fib.Fib and either use a stopwatch to
   time it (observe the LEDs), or let the program do that
   itself, using the system millisecond timer. Then the
   following numbers are displayed:
   ARG together with Fib(ARG), the ARGth Fiboacci number
   number of instructions executed
   runtime in milliseconds
   speed in instructions per second

3) If the experiment is conducted on a real FPGA board, the
   CPI value (cycles per instruction) is:
   CPI = clock cycles per second / instructions per second

4) Please keep in mind that this little benchmark does
   not represent a generally meaningful instruction mix.
   In particular, it does not contain any floating-point
   operations at all in its timing loop.
