This README contains instructions how to re-build
all the binaries in the kit. For this task it is
necessary to have a running Oberon system. So please
do an install first, either on the ECO32 simulator
or on a real FPGA board. Then choose the appropriate
subdirectory and type 'make'. This will present
different options, realized as make targets.
Choose a target and follow the instructions.
