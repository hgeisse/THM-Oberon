This simulator is essentially a RISC5 simulator
augmented with a few ECO32 I/O devices. If you
want to use any ECO32 device, you have to enable
it on the command line (switch '-e'). The command
line switch '-r' removes RISC5 devices (to check,
e.g., whether there is left any I/O access to
this device).


Here is a brief decsription of the ECO32 I/O devices:


Timer
-----

0xC00000	timer control register (r/w)
		bit 0: timer expired
		bit 1: timer interrupt enabled (not yet in HYBRID)
		reading the control register resets the 'expired' flag
		the 'expired' flag cannot be written

0xC00004	timer divisor register (r/w)
		writing to this register also writes to the counter register

0xC00008	timer counter register (r)
		this register cannot be written


Board I/O
---------

0xC10000	buttons, switches, and LEDs (r/w)
		reading returns buttons[3:0] and switches[7:0] in the 12 LSBs
		writing maps the 8 LSBs to the LEDs (1 = on)
