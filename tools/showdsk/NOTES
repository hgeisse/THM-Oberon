Files are stored on disk in units called "sectors" of 1 KB size.
Note that a "sector" normally is called a "block". In accordance
with the SD card specification, a "block" here denotes the storage
unit on an SD card, which is 512 bytes. Note that with respect to
disk storage technology, this normally is called a "sector".
Cheers to consistent terminology! ;-)

The constant "FSoffset" (file system offset) is set to 0 in our
implementation, so that the Oberon file system starts immediately
at the beginning of the storage area, i.e., either the disk image
file or the raw SD card device. Sector 0 is not used; sector 1
holds the root page of the directory.

The single, flat directory is realized as a B-tree. The nodes of
this tree are called "pages". Each page holds up to 24 directory
entries, stored in a single sector.
