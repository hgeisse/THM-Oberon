1) Changes

There are two changes in PROM.v (to avoid a warning from Icarus
and adjust the path to the PROM contents file):

7,8c7,8
< reg [31:0] mem [511: 0];
< initial $readmemh("../prom.mem", mem);
---
> reg [31:0] mem [0:511];
> initial $readmemh("prom.mem", mem);


2) Usage

Copy the desired PROM from subdirectory "proms" to a file with
name "prom.mem" in this directory, then simply "make" the project.
