1) Changes

a) There are two changes in PROM.v (to avoid a warning from Icarus
Verilog and adjust the path to the PROM contents file):

7,8c7,8
< reg [31:0] mem [511: 0];
< initial $readmemh("../prom.mem", mem);
---
> reg [31:0] mem [0:511];
> initial $readmemh("prom.mem", mem);

b) Correct Multiplier.v for unsigned multiplication of big numbers.

c) In RISC5.v set register R15 to zero initially. This is required
for simulating the boot loader, which tests the contents of this
register.


2) Usage

Copy the desired PROM from subdirectory "proms" to a file with
name "prom.mem" in this directory, then simply "make" the project.
