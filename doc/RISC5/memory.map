Memory Map of the RISC5 System
------------------------------

The PC in the original RISC5 design is 22 bits wide, and
it addresses 32-bit (4-byte) words. I find it much more
convenient to write down byte addresses, especially because
these are needed anyway, as the memory provides byte access
to data. The following map presents byte addresses (with
a width of 24 bits, i.e., 6 nibbles).



FFFFFF  +-------------------------+
        | 16 devices, 1 word each |
FFFFC0  +-------------------------+
        |                         |
        |   -- not present --     |
        |                         |
FFE800  +-------------------------+
        |         ROM             |
FFE000  +-------------------------+
        |                         |
        |                         |
        |   -- not present --     |
        |                         |
        |                         |
100000  +-------------------------+
        |     -- not used --      |
0FFF00  +-------------------------+
        |                         |
        |  graphics frame buffer  |
        |                         |
0E7F00  +-------------------------+
        |                         |
        |                         |
        |          RAM            |
        |                         |
        |                         |
000000  +-------------------------+



Notes
-----

1. The graphics frame buffer is both readable and writable. In the
original implementation this is in fact part of the main RAM which
is concurrently read out by the display hardware.

2. On reset, the processor's start address is FFE000.

3. "not present" means that nothing responds at these addresses.

4. "not used" means that these locations are present, but neither
read from nor written to, at least to the best of my knowledge.
