This kit is based on Andreas Pirklbauer's Extended-Oberon-1.6 release.

Dropped from AP's release:
  BootLoadDisk.Mod	bootstrap loader for disk only: not used
  BootLoadLine.Mod	bootstrap loader for serial line only: not used
  Build.Tool		we script the build process on the host system
  Clipboard.Mod		not usable with a real FPGA
  Net.Mod		no net yet
  ORC.Mod		connection to RISC: we use serlink instead
  Oberon0Tool.Mod	no need to run Oberon0 outside of system setup
  PCLink1.Mod		use PCLink2.Mod instead, see below
  PIO.Mod		we don't have a PIC interface
  RISC.Mod		this simulation is much too coarse
  SCC.Mod		no radio yet
  SmallPrograms.Mod	a few example modules in a single source file
  System1.Mod		no need for a boot file with the entire system

Added to AP's release:
  Dummy.Mod		an empty module, used to load the compiler into
			main memory while preparing to rebuild the system
  PCLink2.Mod		replaces PCLink1.Mod: modified file transfer
			protocol with more handshaking to avoid buffer
			overruns, execute commands sent from host system

Modified from AP's release:
  BootLoad.Mod		slightly modified protocol, file system offset
			set to 0, origins and limits changed for 16 MB:
			MemLim = 0FE0000H; stackOrg = 800000H;
  Disk.Mod		locate file system at start of disk: FSoffset = 0;
  Display.Mod		change display base address: base = 0FE0000H;
  Input.Mod		correct key table for German, add ALT modifier
  ORG.Mod		change limits: maxCode = 10000; maxStrx = 3500;
			change code for getting at contents of H register
  ORL.Mod		correct code for clearing mod.name character array
  Oberon0.Mod		change display base address: screenbase = 0FE0000H;
  PCLink0.Mod		implement the same protocol as in PCLink2.Mod
  System.Tool		delete Oberon0Tool.Run and Oberon0Tool.Stop
			change PCLink1.Run/Stop to PCLink2.Run/Stop
