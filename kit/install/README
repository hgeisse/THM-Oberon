This README contains instructions how to install
the Oberon system, either on the RISC-5 simulator
or on a real FPGA board.

--------------------------------
Simulator

	cp ../BootLoad/mem/BootLoad.mem .

	cp ../Boot/bin/Oberon0.bin .

	cp ../InnerCore/bin/Modules.bin .

	cp ../OuterCore/rsc/* .

	cp ../Apps/Compiler/rsc/* .

	cp ../Apps/PCLink1/rsc/* .

	../../build/bin/mkdisk Oberon.dsk 300M

	../../build/bin/sim -s 001 -p BootLoad.mem -d Oberon.dsk

Start the serial connection in a separate terminal:
	../../build/bin/serlink -p /dev/pts/19 -b Oberon0.bin
It will take a while to transmit Oberon0.bin to the target system.
You will first notice the serial link's prompt in the separate
terminal - but please wait and do not enter anything before the
target system is ready to receive commands. This is indicated by
a LED change to "ON   OFF  OFF  OFF  OFF  ON   OFF  OFF", which
is shown in the simulator control window. Now Oberon0 is running
on the target system and waits for commands from the serial link.

	ldboot Modules.bin

Shut down the target system with CTRL-C in the simulator control
window. Quit the serial link program.

Now you can boot your new Oberon system:
	../../build/bin/sim -s 000 -p BootLoad.mem -d Oberon.dsk

--------------------------------
FPGA board

	cp ../Boot/bin/Oberon0.bin .

	cp ../InnerCore/bin/Modules.bin .

	cp ../OuterCore/rsc/* .

Load the RISC-5 configuration into the FPGA.
Set SW-0 to "on". Reset the processor.
The LEDs should show "on off off off off off off on".
Start the serial connection in a separate terminal:
	../../build/bin/serlink -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b Oberon0.bin
It will take a while to transmit Oberon0.bin to the target system.
You will first notice the serial link's prompt in the separate
terminal - but please wait and do not enter anything before the
target system is ready to receive commands. This is indicated by
the LEDs changing to "ON   OFF  OFF  OFF  OFF  ON   OFF  OFF".
Now Oberon0 is running on the target system and waits for commands
from the serial link.
