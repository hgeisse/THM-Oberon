1. Add the following modules to the simulator
   (they are already implemented in the FPGA):
   - keyboard/mouse
   - SD card

2. Replace the following modules with my own
   (and possibly enhanced) implementations:
   - floating-point unit (should become IEEE 754 compliant)
   - PS/2 interfaces for keyboard and mouse (send data to kbd)
   - SD card interface (should become a 4-bit interface)

3. Define and implement a reasonable interrupt system.
