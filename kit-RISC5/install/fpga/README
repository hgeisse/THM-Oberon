It is possible to make a backup copy of a newly installed
Oberon system with the help of an SD card reader:
1. Switch off the FPGA board. Remove the SD card from
   the card cage and insert it into the SD card reader.
2. Connect the SD card reader to a PC (which usually
   means inserting the reader into a USB slot).
3. Copy the relevant part of the SD card to a file.
   NOTE: There is no recognizable file system on the
   card! So you have to copy directly from the bare
   device. Example:
     sudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=Oberon.dsk bs=1M count=300
   This copies 300 MiB from the device /dev/sdb (must
   be your SD card reader) to the file 'Oberon.dsk'.
4. In order to prepare a second SD card with an exact
   copy of the first, insert the card into the reader,
   connect it to the PC, and write the disk image file
   directly to the bare device. Example:
     sudo dd if=Oberon.dsk of=/dev/sdb
   NOTE: Double-check the output specification! This
   *must* be your SD card reader device. Otherwise you
   risk to destroy the file system on your hard disk!
