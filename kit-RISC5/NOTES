This kit is based on Andreas Pirklbauer's Extended-Oberon-1.6 release.

Dropped from AP's release:
  BootLoadDisk.Mod	bootstrap loader for disk only: not used
  BootLoadLine.Mod	bootstrap loader for serial line only: not used
  Build.Tool		we script the build on the host system
  Clipboard.Mod		not usable with a real FPGA
  Net.Mod		no net yet
  ORC.Mod		connection to RISC: we use serlink instead
  Oberon0Tool.Mod	no need to run Oberon0 outside of system setup
  PIO.Mod		we don't have a PIC interface
  RISC.Mod		this simulation is much too coarse
  SCC.Mod		no radio yet
  SmallPrograms.Mod	a few example modules in a single source file
  System1.Mod		no need for a boot file with the entire system

Modified from AP's release:
  PCLink1.Mod		use PCLink2.Mod instead: modified file transfer
			protocol with more handshaking to avoid buffer
			overruns, execute commands sent from host system
  BootLoad.Mod		slightly modified protocol, file system offset
			set to 0, origins and limits changed for 16 MB:
			MemLim = 0FE0000H; stackOrg = 800000H;
  ORG.Mod		change limits: maxCode = 10000; maxStrx = 3500;
  Disk.Mod		locate file system at start of disk: FSoffset = 0;
  Oberon0.Mod		change display base address: screenbase = 0FE0000H;
  PCLink0.Mod		implement the same protocol as in PCLink2.Mod
  Display.Mod		change display base address: base = 0FE0000H;
  Input.Mod		correct key table for German, add ALT modifier
  System.Tool		delete Oberon0Tool.Run and Oberon0Tool.Stop
			change PCLink1.Run/Stop to PCLink2.Run/Stop
